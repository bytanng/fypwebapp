Development has yet to begin

Motivations

In recent years, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) has received feedback from students highlighting the absence of an ideation platform. This hampers studentsâ€™ ability to connect with peers who shares similar interests and skillsets, making it challenging to form teams to participate in competitions and entrepreneurial projects. In collaboration with the NTU Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&E) department, which aims to promote holistic entrepreneurship education and experiential learning, this project aims to empower students with the tools and resources needed to form effective project teams, collaboration, and innovation, through a web application.

Objectives and Scope 

The primary objectives of this project are to design and develop a user-centric web application aimed at supporting the dynamic needs of students within NTU, fostering a positive user experience. The application will serve as a digital platform for students to feature project ideas, showcase their skillsets, and express personal interests. This facilitates the seamless formation of student teams across diverse project types, spanning competitions, entrepreneurship ventures, and collaborative projects of any nature. Additionally, the application aspires to foster a strong social support system within the NTU community, encouraging cross-disciplinary interactions enhancing the overall academic experience. Ultimately, this project aims to deliver an intuitive, engaging, and visually appealing application, aligning with the critical role of User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UI/UX), providing great user experience, allowing NTU students of similar interest to connect.
